BIOPROFEED stands for "Portable BIOsignal acquisition, real time 
PROcessing and FEEDback generation framework".

The main application serves for controlling the data acquisition, 
displaying and saving the data. There are different drivers for 
different hardware available.

*) Building the main application - assumes that the current working
directory is the one where this README can be found:

# cd main
# ./autogen.sh
# make

The application "bsview" can be found under ./src .

*) Building the testmodule - assumes that the current working directory is
the one where this README can be found:

(Additional building instructions for each module can be found in
the README in each subdirectory.)

# cd modules/testmodule
# ./autogen.sh
# make

The module "testdriver.la" can be found under ./src .

*) Note - when compiling under Cygwin the contents of "testdriver.la" has
to be modified in the following way:


Testing
=======

Assumes that the current working directory is the one where this 
README can be found:

# cd main/src
# export BSV_MODULE_PATH=`pwd`/../../modules/testmodule/src
# ./bsview testmodule


Cleanup
=======

Assumes that the current working directory is the one where this 
README can be found:
