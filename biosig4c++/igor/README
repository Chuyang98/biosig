# Biosig's XOP interface to IGOR
# Copyright 2010 Alois Schloegl <alois.schloegl@gmail.com>

This is currently in an experimental state. 

An open issue is, that biosig4c++/libbiosig compiles 
with GNU C++ compiler, but the supported platforms for Igor
XOP's are only Mac and MS-Windows (MS VisualC++) 
Therefore, there are three options, (A) mixing MinGW and MSVC++,
(B) moving everthing to MinGW, and (C) moving everything to MSVC++. 
Every option has currently one or more open issues: 
 
(A) mingw/libbiosig + MSVC++/xop
- alignment of struct variables

(B) MinGW/libbiosig + MinGW/xop
- MinGW-based XOP ? 

(C) MSVC++/libbiosig + MSVC++/xop (MSVC++-based libbiosig) 
- alignment 
- GNU specific extensions
