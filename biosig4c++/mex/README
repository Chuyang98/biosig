This provides a language binding of libbiosig to Matlab and Octave. 
Basically, mex-files for loading biosig data are provided.
- mexSLOAD.mex* loads the whole file (header and data). 
- mexSOPEN.mex* reads only the header information. 


COMPILATION: 

== Octave on Linux =======================
On Linux platforms the compilation is straight forward. The prerequisites are 
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsuitesparse-dev octave-headers
The mex files for Octave are generated with 
	make mex4o 


== Matlab on Linux =======================
Prerequisites:
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libsuitesparse-dev octave-headers
Edit Makefile and set the correct path to Matlab:
The mex files for Matlab are generated with 
	make mex4m


== Matlab (v7.0 - v7.6) on Win32 =========
For Matlab (v7.0 - v7.6) on MS-Windows, MinGW and GNUMEX are recommended. 
After setup of MinGW and GNUMEX, mexSLOAD can be compiled in the following way

   - start matlab
   - change directory to .../biosig4c++ 
   - and run this command: 
   mex mexSLOAD.cpp win32/libbiosig.lib win32/zlib/lib/zdll.lib c:\MinGWtdm\lib\libws2_32.a -output matlab/mexSLOAD

The procedure does not work on v7.11 because gnumex was not compatible. (It is not clear when between 7.6 and 7.11 gnumex did not work anymore)


== Matlab v7.11 for Win32 ================
Compilation was successful using the mingw-cross-env on linux to generate Win32/mex files. 
GnuMex/Mingw must be installed together with Matlab on windows.
The gnumex libraries must be copied to the linux machine having MinGW-Cross-env installed. 
Adapt the Makefile and run 
	make mexw32
