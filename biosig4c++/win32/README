Introduction:
---------------

The directory ../biosig4c++/windows contains the pre-compiled 
(i.e. executable) file format converter SAVE2GDF for Windows platform.   

If you compile with -D=WITH_ZLIB, You need to copy zlib1.dll to 
the SYSTEM or the SYSTEM32 directory. 

File(s): 
-------------
    README 		this file
    zlib1.dll		zlib dll - copy zlib1.dll to the SYSTEM or the SYSTEM32 directory.
    			Or you get zlib1.dll from http://www.zlib.net/zlib123-dll.zip
    save2gdf.exe	converter between various file formats.
    rec2bin.bat    	converts any raw data format into BIN-format

    getlogin_r.c	function needed but not supported by Windows
    
    		 
Compilation: 
-------------
The files were already compiled with MinGW and WITH_ZLIB for the i386-platform.
 
If this is not suitable, you need to compile the files from the sources.
