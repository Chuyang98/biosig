Introduction:
---------------

The directory ../biosig4c++/windows contains the pre-compiled 
(i.e. executable) file format converter SAVE2GDF for Windows platform.   

If you compile with -D=WITH_ZLIB, You need to copy zlib1.dll to 
the SYSTEM or the SYSTEM32 directory. 

File(s): 
-------------
    README 		this file
    Qt*.dll		qt library used by sigviewer		
    save2gdf.exe	converter between various file formats.
    rec2bin.bat    	converts any raw data format into BIN-format
    			an ASCII-header and Binary channels file
    bin2rec.bat		converts the BIN formated data into any other format (default=GDF)
    getlogin_r.c	function needed but not supported by Windows
    eventcodes.txt	table of event codes
    sigviewer.exe	experimental version of sigviewer 
    
    		 
Compilation: 
-------------
The files were already compiled with MinGW and WITH_ZLIB for the i386-platform.
 

# MinGW Crosscompiler on Linux for Windows  
Currently, only the file converter save2gdf is supported.
- install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime
- If you want to have zlib-support 
	- patch mingw include fil(e) with 
		patch_mingw_avoid_io_h.diff
	- in Makefile add -D=WITH_ZLIB to MinGWDEF
- adapt the path to mingw in Makefile	
- run the command  
        make win32 


# Windows + MinGW
<this option is currently broken: fixes are welcome>
Only the file converter save2gdf is supported.
- You need MinGW with g++ and make.
- run the make command 
   make -f Makefile.win32 save2gdf.exe


	
Installation: 
-------------
