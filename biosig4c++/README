Introduction:
---------------

The aim of this repository is providing a C/C++ software library for biomedical signal processing. 
This library is called "BioSig for C/C++" and is complementary to "BioSig for Octave and Matlab".  

The most important application is a converter between different file formats, 
including but not limited to SCP-ECG(EN1064), HL7aECG (FDA-XML), GDF, EDF, BDF, CWFB.

The internal data structure resemble the header structure similar 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/biosig/biosig/doc/header.txt
and is defined in
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/biosig/biosig4c%2B%2B/biosig.h
(see HDRTYPE and CHANNEL_TYPE)

Encoding of Event/Markers/Annotations is available here: 
http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/matlab/eeg/EventCodes.html

The latest list of supported data formats is available here: 
http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/biosig/TESTED

    Makefile	script for compiling and testing 
    
		
Compilation: 
-------------
# Linux 
you need g++ and make. Running make compiles the converter
  make
  make mex

# Cygwin
install g++, make (optionally zlib) and compile it. 

# Other platforms (Windows, MGwin, MacOSX, Solaris, etc. )
Not tested (yet). Let me know about successful compilations, 
or tell me what changes are needed.   


Binary Install:
----------------
Precompiled binaries might be available here:
http://www.openecg.net/SCP_aECG_Converter.htm 



Execution:
----------
# if test.gdf exists, some header information is displayed
./demo test.gdf     		

# help and usage information 
./save2gdf -h

# converts a data file into a GDF format (destination
./save2gdf PFE103.scp t5.gdf     		

# converts a data file into a SCP format (destination
./save2scp t5.gdf t5.scp      		
./save2gdf -f=SCP t5.gdf t5.scp      		

# converts a data file into a HL7aECG format (destination
./save2aecg t5.gdf t5.hl7      		
./save2gdf -f=HL7aECG t5.gdf t5.hl7


Open Issue(s) of the SCP-ECG <-> HL7aECG converter:
---------------------------------------------------
The following fields of SCP-ECG are not converted to HL7. 
= Mandatory fields (prEN1064:2007 p.18, chp 5.4.3.1) not propagated to HL7:  
- time zone information, (tag34, section 1)
- "ID of acquiring device" (tag14, section 1)
= "Highly recommended" fields (prEN1064:2007 p.18, chp 5.4.3.1) not propagated to HL7:  
- "ID of analysing device", Patient first name, 
= Other fields of the SCP-ECG standard, 
- section 1: blood pressure, medication, etc
- section 4 (QRS location), 7 (global measurements), 8-11 (interpretative statements)
The following fields of HL7aECG are not converted to SCP-ECG.
- study, treatment group, clinical trial, clinical trial protocol, trial sponsor, investigator etc. 


Development & Testing:
----------------------
There are several testing functions included. 
The following commands test the converter and should finish without errors.  
	make test 
	make testhl7
	make testscp
	make test6

The Octave/Matlab script 
	test0/test01.m 
tests whether the various data formats give the same results 
or whether some conversion error has been included.
