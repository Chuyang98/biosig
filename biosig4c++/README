Introduction:
---------------

The aim of this repository is providing a C/C++ software library for biomedical signal processing. 
This library is called "BioSig for C/C++" and is complementary to "BioSig for Octave and Matlab".  

The most important application is a converter between different file formats, 
including but not limited to SCP-ECG(EN1064), HL7aECG (FDA-XML), GDF, EDF, BDF, CWFB.

The internal data structure resemble the header structure similar 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/biosig/biosig/doc/header.txt
and is defined in
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/biosig/biosig4c%2B%2B/biosig.h
(see HDRTYPE and CHANNEL_TYPE)

Encoding of Event/Markers/Annotations is available here: 
http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/matlab/eeg/EventCodes.html

The latest list of supported data formats is available here: 
http://hci.tugraz.at/schloegl/biosig/TESTED

    README 	this file
    biosig.h	definition of biosig data structures	
    biosig.c	SOPEN, SREAD, SWRITE, SEOF, SCLOSE functions 
    demo.c	demo how to use them
    save2gdf.c	converter between various file formats.
    t210/*	reading SCP file format 
    t220/*      writing SCP file format 
    t230/*      support of HL7aECG file format 
    test0/*	scripts and functions for testing
    Makefile	script for compiling and testing 
    
		
Compilation: 
-------------
# Linux 
you need g++ and make. Running make compiles the converter
$make<CR>

# Cygwin
install g++, make (optionally zlib) and compile it. 

# Other platforms (Windows, MGwin, MacOSX, Solaris, etc. )
Not tested (yet). Let me know about successful compilations, 
or tell me what changes are needed.   


Binary Install:
----------------
Precompiled binaries might be available here:
http://www.openecg.net/SCP_aECG_Converter.htm 



Execution:
----------
# if test.gdf exists, some header information is displayed
./demo test.gdf     		

# help and usage information 
./save2gdf -h

# converts a data file into a GDF format (destination
./save2gdf PFE103.scp t5.gdf     		

# converts a data file into a SCP format (destination
./save2scp t5.gdf t5.scp      		
./save2gdf -f=SCP t5.gdf t5.scp      		

# converts a data file into a HL7aECG format (destination
./save2aecg t5.gdf t5.hl7      		
./save2gdf -f=HL7aECG t5.gdf t5.hl7
