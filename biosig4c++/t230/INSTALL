For users of Debian Linux or derived distributions: 

install libxerces27-dev with 
    sudo apt-get install libxerces27-dev 
    


Otherwise


0. install and build Xerces-C 2.7 source distribution (normally I
install it to /usr/local)
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/

1. download XQilla cvs with commands

   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@xqilla.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xqilla login

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@xqilla.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xqilla co -P xqilla

to appropiate directory (I use /usr/local/src;)

2. run ./configure --with-xerces="path to Xerces source root"

3. If your flex/lex does not understand Unicode, then enter
xqilla/src/lexer directory and touch all cpp, hpp and h files
(only one should be touched but I don't remember which one;) to
prevent make calling flex. Actually a regular user doesn't need
to rebuild these files (see details at pathan 2 building
instructions).

4. make/make install xqilla

5. check that library path in my sample's Makefile points to
correct location of libxerces and libxqilla.

[just in case] Please note that linking depends on the library
order in linker command line. I forgot that this is normal with
gcc and it was an unpleasant surprise for me;)

Hope that these help.
